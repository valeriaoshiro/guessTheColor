# Guess The Color
Completed January 10, 2017

This is a game to test your RGB knowledge. On the top, you are given a RGB color, and on the bottom, you have 6 different color squares. One of them is the right answer. There is an easy mode (3 squares) and hard mode (6 squares and default option). There is also a button to give you new colors, or play again. 

Good luck!
